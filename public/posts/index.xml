      <description>Permaculture is a holistic approach to designing sustainable ecosystems that are self-sufficient and require little maintenance. It is based on the principles of earth care, people care, and fair share. The goal of permaculture is to create a system where everything works together in harmony - from the smallest microorganisms in the soil to the largest trees in the forest.
In today&amp;rsquo;s world, where climate change and environmental degradation are major concerns, permaculture offers an alternative way of living that is kinder to our planet.</description>
